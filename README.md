## About In-App Messaging and Voice

The Nexmo In-App Messaging and Voice APIs enables you to build conversation features where communication can take place across multiple mediums. The context of the conversations is maintained though each communication event taking place within a conversation, no matter the medium.

Currently the API offers basic IP messaging with the following features:

- Conversation creation and management
- Sending and receiving text
- Member invite management
- Cache support
- Typing indicators
- Message sent, delivered and read receipts
- Image support
- Voice support
